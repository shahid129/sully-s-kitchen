A very Comprehensive and easy to navigate restaurant menu is created to give the audience full comfortness while using the restaurant menu. It is a fine dining restaurant where people will have to book in advance to ensure the avalablity of the seat-in capacity. in this way the customers will get 100% attention of the staff, and proper guest care would be taken. customer satisfiction and quality of the food is our main aim.

## DESCRIPTION
This project was created with the intention of making a user friendly website, where customers can easily navigate between the pages and be able to find their required documents. The site is simple enough even for a person with no or little experience would be able to use it.
  
## THEMES
The themes chosen for this project was a restaurant and I wanted to make the page as simple as possible. Only two types of font I used and they are 

 - Raleway for logo and heading
 - Mmooch Sans for body

 I used only two minimum colors all throughout the project and they are
 - rgb(221, 214, 214) for background.
 - black for text.
 - #F3F3F3 for background.
 - rgba221,214,214 for form.
 - rgb(38, 1, 1) for buttons
 - #888888 for button shadow.

The color contrast between the foreground and the background is well maintained throughout the project.

## FEATURES

 

 > Navigation Menu [See Image](/assets/docs/navigation.png)

 The Navigation Menu is inside the header section and stays on the right hand side of the laptop screen. As the screen becomes smaller, or on small mobile device the menus comes down the logo. I did not use the hamburger menu because I tried to stick to course module as much as I could, even though I used css flexbox.
 > Logo [See Image](/assets/docs/logo.png)
 
 Logo is simply the name of the restaurant with a sub heading underneath it. The logo creates a link to the home page and can be accessed from anywhere within the site.

 > Favicon [See Image](/assets/docs/favicon.png)

Favicon is simply  the first two letters of Sully's Kitchen. Blue background with white text gives a nice, clean professional look Favicon is created using the [favicon](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) website.

> Hero Image [See Image](/assets/docs/hero.png)

The Hero image was chosen very carefully to give a good flavour of curry and Indian restaurant. Different types of spices and seeds gives a proper indication about what type of restaurant is this.
